## Abstract

The Synthetic Data Compliance Framework (SDCF) provides a purpose-bounded methodology for assessing whether synthetic data is fit for a specific intended use. The framework evaluates synthetic data across three dimensions—Privacy, Fidelity, and Fairness—using a tiered assessment approach (Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on available source data access.
